# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System Backend

[FrontEnd Repo](https://github.com/ely-herrera/RestaurantReservationSystem-FrontEnd)

This my full-stack capstone project for Thinkful, which demonstrates my use of React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. For this project, I built both the client and the API to support the app.

> Periodic Tables is a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants. The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation. At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

The following user stories were implemented into the application:
* **US-01:** As a restaurant manager
I want to create a new reservation when a customer calls
so that I know how many customers will arrive at the restaurant on a given day.
* **US-02:** As a restaurant manager
I only want to allow reservations to be created on a day when we are open
so that users do not accidentally create a reservation for days when we are closed.
* **US-03:** As a restaurant manager
I only want to allow reservations to be created during business hours, up to 60 minutes before closing
so that users do not accidentally create a reservation for a time we cannot accommodate.
* **US-04:** As a restaurant manager,
When a customer with an existing reservation arrives at the restaurant
I want to seat (assign) their reservation to a specific table
so that I know which tables are occupied and free.
* **US-05:** As a restaurant manager
I want to free up an occupied table when the guests leave
so that I can seat new guests at that table.
* **US-06:** As a restaurant manager
I want a reservation to have a status of either booked, seated, or finished
so that I can see which reservation parties are seated, and finished reservations are hidden from the dashboard.
* **US-07:** As a restaurant manager
I want to search for a reservation by phone number (partial or complete)
so that I can quickly access a customer's reservation when they call about their reservation.
* **US-08:** As a restaurant manager
I want to be able to modify a reservation if a customer calls to change or cancel their reservation
so that reservations are accurate and current.
